## Hi :D

I'm **Hung Phan Quoc Viet**, currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics** at the **University of Utah**. My interests lies in these specific fields:

- 🔍 **Deep Learning**: I’m particularly fascinated by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their applications in computer vision and scene understanding.
- 📊 **Graph Theory**: I'm interested in classic problems in graph theory, such as the shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and network flow, among others as well as solving any graph related problems.
- 🎮 **Real-time Rendering**: I enjoy learning about how graphics techniques can be applied to create visually immersive and responsive environments.
