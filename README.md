My name is Hung, I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of Utah. I have experience in back-end development and data science. Currently, I am learning topics in computer graphics, computer systems, and probably some AI/ML.

In my free time, I enjoy sleeping, listening to music, playing the piano, and solving coding problems whenever I feel like it. Some of my active profiles are linked above if you’re interested :D :D
